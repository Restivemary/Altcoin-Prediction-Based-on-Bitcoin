In this analysis, we used cryptocurrency market data to predict which altcoin (from a 
set of six) would deliver the highest return over the next 12-hour interval. We tested 
simple models, ensemble approaches, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).The 
Decision Tree Classifier achieved an average profit of 13% over two weeks. By 
combining models into an ensemble, we improved performance to an average profit of 
20% in the same period. We also implemented RNNs, which produced an average profit 
of 6%. Our findings also showed that changes in Bitcoin’s price, the number of 
consecutive positive days for Bitcoin, and Google Trends data are valuable predictors 
for identifying profitable altcoins.
